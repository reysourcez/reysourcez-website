/* ============================================================
   Site Navigation Config — single source of truth
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   The "Business Analysis" dropdown used to be a hand-written
   <li> list, duplicated identically in every page's <nav> — adding
   one new tool meant editing every existing HTML file (or asking
   whichever AI session owned each one to do it). This file is the
   fix: the list of pages lives here, ONCE, and every page that
   loads this script renders its own dropdown from it.

   TO ADD A NEW PAGE: add one line to RZ_NAV_PAGES below. Nothing
   else on any page needs to change — no HTML edits, no asking an
   AI to touch a page it doesn't own. See SITE_CONFIG_STANDARD.md
   for the one-time retrofit a page needs before it picks this up.

   aria-current="page" is worked out here too, from the browser's
   own URL — one less thing to remember to move by hand when a page
   is added, renamed, or reordered (see the 2026-09-08 and
   2026-09-17 change-note entries on other pages for how easy this
   was to get out of sync doing it manually).

   2026-09-23: added iso-ms-architect.html (ISO Management System
   Architect) — one line, per the rule above. Built already reading
   from this file rather than a hand-written dropdown, since it's a
   new page (see SITE_CONFIG_STANDARD.md's retrofit checklist).
